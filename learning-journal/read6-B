# Computer Architecture and logic 

### Computers are everywhere in your pocket bagpack and everywhere, in many shapes and forms. humens invented many machines to do physical activity and computers are a thinking machine. it's work is very simple computers input, srtore, process and output information, these four thing are common to all computers. the input is i what you want the computer to do then the input is stored waiting to be processed, the processor then process the stored information and output it, the out put information is different depending on what the combuter is designed to do.the output can be a photo, video, sound ...ect. in the case of internet the output of one computer is the input of another computer.

### computer works using a binary system (1s and 0s), the 1 means a wire is on ( there is a current), the 0 means a wire is off ( there is no current), the 0 or 1 is called a bit which is the smallest type of data in the computer, a bit carried by a wire. more wires means more data means the more complex the information. images are outputed by giving colors to the pixels, he videos are represented just like the image but multiplied by usaully 30 times, sounds are waveforms the the sounds are represented by assigning the the sound with numbers. the more bits the better the sound is, so 32-bits is better than 8-bit.

### every input and output is a type of information that can be represented by the binary system, the computer needs to modify and compain the input to generate the output, it's processed by tiny circuit like a not, buffer, and, or ...ect. these gates can be connected togeather to form adders, multipliers ...ect. hence the computer's
ability to do basic and complix calculations.
