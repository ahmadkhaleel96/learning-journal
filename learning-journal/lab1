## _grwoth mindset_

#### beign a fixed minded person means that you are throwing away the key for your creativity. enabling you to have higher goals and even a higher motivation to face these goals, and work much much harder than anyone else, because everything in this life comes ~~easy~~ (notice the strakethrough) it is just a sign to get this word out of any conversation in your life nothing comes easy even for talented people.

#### a quote for a dude in some podcast i heard the other day (here is the link), [grwoth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) came with an amazing quote:
> self, you need to embrace the grwoth mindset. the growth mindset is cool.

#### grwoth mindset is the best tool to achieve any goal even if you are not talented but the time you put on pays off. grwoth minded people are accepting to critisim and build upon it, and are inspired ny other successful people.

#### here is a list of __VERY__ successful people in the world:
- elon musk
- christiano ronaldo
- steve jobs
